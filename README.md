# Allies
Pretty simple prototype project designed with the theme of Unconventional Weapons. This was
built over the course of a few weeks but I kept adding to it. Ideally I will add several levels, 
including a tutorial and there will be some kind of progression with enemies.  Who knows!

## Try Recent Build
Sometimes I will probably post an updated binary to [Itch.io](https://redtoorange.itch.io/allies), but
the best option is to build from source if you can.  The project should run fine under the free version
of Unity with a version of `2020.2.0b7+`.  

## Building From Source
This project was created using Unity `2020.2.0b7+` as a URP Project with 2D 
URP enabled. This is a pretty experimental thing, so it probably will break if you try to 
open the project with an earlier version.
